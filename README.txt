HOW TO RUN IT :

If you want to choose your own parameters (min and max angle for the camera, max distance between human and robot, duration of the following behavior, and speed of the camera), you can rosrun the file action_server.py and then rosrun actionlib axclient.py /follow_people

Note that the robot can sometimes be a bit slow while following somebody.
